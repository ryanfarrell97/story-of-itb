				<p>Following my meeting with Roisin Long, a staff member working in the NLN in the A Block, I found out a few very interesting things.
				<br>
				The NLN was first brought into ITB in 2003 and has been a part of the college for 15 years
				<br>
				They are an educational psychological support service that offers supports in academics, wellbeing, social, organisation and there's a recognised overlap between academic ability and personal wellbeing.
				<br>
				Most students will use it for needs assessments that are useful for exam accomodations, CA project help and other specific supports if necessary.
				<br>
				A survey was carried out in 2017-18 that found that 131 students had registered with the service, 400+ appointments with the NLN were offered last year and that cards helped student engagement with the service.
				<br>
				The most availed of services they offer are needs assessments, study skills, essay writing, stress management and help with adjusting to life at 3rd level.
				<br>
				The purpose of the NLN's drop in service is to remove that formal barrier to help students feel at ease, and being a support service, they will try to help and support students in reaching their potential.
				<br>
				<br>
				From the 2017/18 survey
				<br>
				72% of students felt the NLN supports helped improve their grades.
				<br>
				Of the students who reported having anxiety issues, 80% said that going to the NLN helped manage it.
				<br>
				15 students reported that the NLN changed their minds about dropping out of college.
				<br>
				97% of the students who went to the NLN would recommend them to a classmate.
				<br>
				The supports most valued by students were academic supports and having someone to talk to about the overall college experience.
